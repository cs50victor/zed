[![Zed Extreme](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vic8or/zed-extreme/main/assets/badge/v0-extreme.json)](https://github.com/vic8or/zed-extreme)

An opinionated personal fork of [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) featuring experimental capabilities not currently on the official roadmap. This fork explores an  approach to achieving "code at the speed of thought."

**Note:** This project is not affiliated with the Zed team. It's a personal fork implementing features I find essential that aren't prioritized in the near-term roadmap. I maintain this fork in my spare time as an exploration to help speed up productivity at my full-time job.

## Contributing

I welcome performance improvements, bug fixes, and suggestions. However, for most contributions, please submit PRs and issues to the official Zed repository: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed
